# CSITOverflow-Frontend

## Overview

During my internship, I discovered the complexities of operating within an air gap environment. In search of a collaborative platform for people to exchange ideas and solutions, I developed this full stack web application. This application serves as a simplified variation of Stack Overflow, tailored to the company's needs.

This frontend application is built using React. The backend application is built using Node, Express and MongoDB. Refer to [here](https://github.com/jicsontoh/CSITOverflow-Backend) for the backend code repository.
